Develop a Library Management System using JDBC to interact with a database and implement custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.

Requirements:

Database Setup:

Create a database named LibraryDB.

Create a table named Books with the following columns:
book_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
title (VARCHAR(100))
author (VARCHAR(50))
published_year (INT)
available_copies (INT)

Java Application:

Implement a Book class with properties: bookId, title, author, publishedYear, and availableCopies.

Implement a BookDAO (Data Access Object) class to handle database operations using JDBC. The class should include the following methods:

addBook(Book book): Adds a new book to the database.

getBookById(int bookId): Retrieves a book by its ID.

updateBook(Book book): Updates an existing book's details.

deleteBook(int bookId): Deletes a book by its ID.

borrowBook(int bookId): Decrements the available copies of a book by 1.

returnBook(int bookId): Increments the available copies of a book by 1.

Custom Exceptions:

Create a custom exception class named BookNotFoundException to handle cases where a book is not found in the database.

Create another custom exception class named DatabaseConnectionException to handle database connection errors.

Create a custom exception class named InsufficientCopiesException to handle cases where a book cannot be borrowed due to lack of available copies.
