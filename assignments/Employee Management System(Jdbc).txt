Develop an Employee Management System using JDBC to interact with a database and custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios.

Requirements:

Database Setup:

Create a database named CompanyDB.
Create a table named Employees with the following columns:
employee_id (INT, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
first_name (VARCHAR(50))
last_name (VARCHAR(50))
age (INT)
department (VARCHAR(50))
salary (DECIMAL)

Java Application:

Implement an Employee class with properties: employeeId, firstName, lastName, age, department, and salary.

Implement an EmployeeDAO (Data Access Object) class to handle database operations using JDBC. The class should include the following methods:

addEmployee(Employee employee): Adds a new employee to the database.

getEmployeeById(int employeeId): Retrieves an employee by their ID.

updateEmployee(Employee employee): Updates an existing employee's details.

deleteEmployee(int employeeId): Deletes an employee by their ID.

Custom Exceptions:

Create a custom exception class named EmployeeNotFoundException to handle cases where an employee is not found in the database.

Create another custom exception class named DatabaseConnectionException to handle database connection errors.
