Problem Statement: Online Bookstore

Description: Build an online bookstore application where users can browse, search, and purchase books. The application should follow the principles of dependency injection using Spring Core.

Requirements:

Book Management:

Define a Book class with properties like id, title, author, price, and category.

Create a BookRepository interface for basic CRUD operations.

Implement a BookService class that provides business logic for managing books.

User Management:

Define a User class with properties like id, name, email, and password.

Create a UserRepository interface for basic CRUD operations.

Implement a UserService class that handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Shopping Cart:

Create a Cart class to represent a user's shopping cart.

Implement methods to add, remove, and view items in the cart.

Provide a CartService class to handle cart-related operations.

Order Processing:

Define an Order class with properties like orderId, userId, orderDate, and a list of Book objects.

Create an OrderRepository interface for basic CRUD operations.

Implement an OrderService class that handles order creation, viewing order history, and order cancellation.

Dependency Injection:

Use Spring Core's dependency injection to manage the creation and injection of service and repository beans.

Configure the application context using XML or Java-based configuration.

Database Integration:

Integrate with a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to persist data.

Use Spring JDBC or JPA for database operations.

User Interface:

Develop a simple user interface using Spring MVC or any other framework of your choice.

Implement views for browsing books, user registration, login, cart management, and order processing.
