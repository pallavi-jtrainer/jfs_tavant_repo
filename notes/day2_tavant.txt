inheritance
overriding
final - method, class
composition 
aggregation
collections
abstract classes and methods
interface and functional interfaces
lambda expressions
-----------------------------------------------------
Abstract classes - classes which cannot be instantiated
can have both concrete and abstract methods
constructors are unnecessary

Interfaces
fully abstract classes
methods in an interface are by default abstract
cannot be instantiated


An interface with only one abstract method -> functional interface
we can have static and default methods inside a functional interface


Final - constant, cannot be changed
-variables 
	on spot initialize
	constructor
	initialization block
-methods
	cannot be overridden
-classes
	cannot be inherited

Collections:
Iterable <- Iterator

List
	ArrayList
	LinkedList
	Stack
	Vector
